![Four linked web pages](wireframes/2326897.png)

## Set-up
- Follow the instructions in [start-guide](../start-guide.md)

## Instructions
- On the route `/`, serve the verse "This is the song that doesn't end.", [a corresponding image](http://rophydoes.rintin.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/lambchop1.jpg), and a link to `/verse-2`.

- On the route `/verse-2`, serve the verse "It just goes on and on my friends.", [a corresponding image](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/1_47KVJV8DU/mqdefault.jpg), and a link to `/verse-3`.

- On the route `/verse-3`, serve the verse "And they'll just continue singing it on forever because...", [the third image](http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/4d/61/6c/4d616c5f67a37d1b7db7acc79a3dcf03.jpg), and a link to `/verse-4`.

- On the route `/verse-3`, serve the verse "...some people started singing it without knowing what it was.", [the third image](http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/75/a1/d4/75a1d4cba1954c1abee9b4bd85d21de9.jpg), and a link to `/`.

- Refactor your code to have one route--not four.
